# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide a filterable table to display the UFO sighting information categorized by date, cities, states, countries and the shape of the sighted object. User of the table can input search criteria and the table will display corresponding corresponding data.

## Results
The webpage makes the searching of the sighting much easier because one does not need to mannually apply filters. The filtering process can be done simply by typing into the textbox. It can also apply multiple filters simultaneously. For instance, if one wants to search for the sightings in El Cajon on 1/1/2010, that person must type "1/20/2010" in the date box and "el cajon" in the city box. The result will display the corresponding sighting information.

## Summary
One drawback of this design is that the search is case sensitive. Because all the cities in the database is in lowercases, if one types upper case in the search box, the result will not to be correctly displayed. Since duration is a numerical value, I recommend establishing a filter that can put the list in orders, such as from shortest duration to longest duration. The same concept can be applied to the "Date" column. I also recommend to add a function that can filter the comments by keywords.
